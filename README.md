# UI Engineer Pairing Assessment

To get a feel for how you build UI, we'd like to you approach a problem which demonstrate your understanding of design, HTML, CSS, accessibility and JavaScript.

Our short timeframe will probably not allow you to code as if it were production-ready, however, we'd like you to demonstrate the thought processes and implementation details required assuming you were building this for production.

While there are small-screen and wider-screen layout designs provided for the task, it's important to note that they are simply design suggestions. No colours or sizes will be provided, because part of being a great UI Engineer is your "feel" for UI design and system design as a whole. You're free to implement or suggest changes that you feel creates a better experience.

To complete the task, you can choose to use either React or Vue. We would encourage you to scaffold a new project with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) or [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) before the pairing to ensure you can start writing code straight away. Make sure you include any dependencies you intend to use, such as Sass.

## Task

We'd like you to create a typical responsive header and navigation menu.

See [task-1.png](/designs/task-1.png) for a suggested design approach.

#### Requirements:

* On narrow screens, the header will consist of a logo and "hamburger" button.
* Upon pressing the hamburger, the navigation menu will open, which lists the various options.
* On wider screens, the menu options are visible by default and right-aligned within the width-constrained header.
* When a user has shown intent to activate a particular item, it should be indicated as such.
* Use the provided SVGs in `/assets/images` for the logos and icons.

The menu options are:

* Dashboard
* Search
* Bookings
* Job Board
* How to Guide

#### Things we're looking for:

* Imagine this is the very first thing to be built in our re-platforming project. What "foundations" would need to be set up to start?
* While there are only 3 SVGs here, how might we best accommodate a system of 50 SVGs?
* Which HTML elements should be used to accommodate the requirements?
* What accessibility considerations are there?
